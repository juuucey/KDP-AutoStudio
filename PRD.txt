KDP AutoStudio (Local Edition)
AI-powered desktop research & design studio for Amazon KDP creators
________________________________________
1. Overview
What is this app?
KDP AutoStudio is a local desktop application that automates the entire Amazon KDP book creation pipeline — from market research and idea validation to interior and cover design — using AI reasoning (OpenAI) and AI design generation (Affinity AI).
The app analyzes competitors, identifies profitable book ideas, scores them, and then helps you produce professional, KDP-ready books using integrated AI and Affinity’s design automation.

2. Objectives & Success Metrics
Primary objectives
1.	Automate 80% of the KDP book research and production workflow.
2.	Produce KDP-compliant book files (cover, interior, metadata) with minimal manual input.
3.	Shorten time from idea → publishable bundle to under 1 hour.
4.	Improve book sales performance by targeting high-demand / low-competition niches.
Success metrics
•	≥60% reduction in research-to-production time.
•	≥70% of AI-suggested ideas meet defined demand thresholds.
•	0 preflight validation errors for produced files.
•	25% higher first-month sales compared to manually created titles.

3. Target User
Primary persona:
Independent or small-team KDP publishers who produce low- or medium-content books (journals, planners, activity books, puzzle books, coloring books).
They want to:
•	Research profitable book niches quickly
•	Generate high-quality interiors and covers
•	Maintain creative control while reducing repetitive design tasks
•	Keep all files local for privacy and speed

4. Key Features
🧠 AI Research & Idea Generation (OpenAI + Local Webscraper)
•	Local Python-based scraper collects Amazon KDP competitor data (titles, subtitles, price, BSR, categories, reviews, etc.).
•	OpenAI API summarizes findings and produces:
o	Market insights (“why it sells / why not”)
o	Idea clustering & scoring (demand, competition, novelty)
o	Suggested book angles and templates
•	Generates a spreadsheet-style backlog of potential books stored locally in SQLite.
📊 Idea Backlog & Scoring
•	Each idea stored with key attributes:
Keyword | Demand | Competition | Novelty | Risk | Profitability | Score
•	Sort, filter, and approve ideas for production.
•	AI explanations accompany each score for transparency.
🎨 AI-Driven Design (Affinity AI + OpenAI)
•	OpenAI API: Generates textual content — titles, subtitles, keywords, blurbs, descriptions, journaling prompts, puzzle instructions, etc.
•	Affinity AI (local):
o	AI Image generation for covers (backgrounds, motifs, textures)
o	AI Inpainting & Vectorization for refinement
o	AI Color Harmony & Typography suggestions
o	Automatic spine and layout adjustments
•	Integrated macros allow one-click creation of:
o	Cover files (.afdesign, .pdf, .png)
o	Interior layouts (.afpub, .pdf)
•	Designer can fine-tune outputs within Affinity before export.
🧾 Metadata & SEO Assistant
•	OpenAI drafts metadata: title, subtitle, 7 KDP keywords, BISAC categories, description variations.
•	Built-in compliance filter flags trademarked or risky keywords.
🧰 Packaging & Validation
•	Local pre-flight validation for:
o	Trim size, bleed, page count, spine width, margins
o	Font embedding, color space, DPI
•	Exports KDP-ready .zip bundle containing:
o	interior.pdf
o	cover.pdf
o	mockup.png
o	metadata.json
o	readme.txt
📈 Analytics (Optional)
•	Local script fetches daily BSR, reviews, and price changes for published ASINs.
•	Dashboards display which niches and styles perform best.

6. Workflow
Step 1: Research & Scoring
•	User enters seed keywords (e.g., “gratitude journal”, “kids handwriting workbook”).
•	Scraper gathers top-selling listings (ASINs, ranks, pricing, reviews).
•	OpenAI summarizes and scores niches; outputs structured backlog.
•	Results are saved in local database and displayed in app.
Step 2: Review Backlog
•	Sort by score, seasonality, or risk.
•	Inspect AI reasoning (“why it sells / why not”).
•	Approve promising ideas for production.
Step 3: Design with AI
•	App passes approved ideas to Affinity AI:
o	Generate and refine covers/interiors with macros.
o	Import AI-generated content from OpenAI (titles, copy, prompts).
o	Adjust automatically to KDP trim and spine requirements.
Step 4: Validate & Package
•	App runs preflight check (PDF size, bleed, fonts, DPI, spine width).
•	Exports final files into /KDP_AutoStudio/Projects/{bookTitle}/bundle.zip.
Step 5: Track Performance (optional)
•	Input published ASINs; app fetches metrics and updates analytics.
